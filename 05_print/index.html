  ### Week 5: 3D Printing 

  While pondering this week's assignment to create, I realized that I missed Ghungroo, Harvard's dance troupe show celebrating South Asian culture.
  To make up for it, I decided to create a 3D representation of a mandala, a good-luck symbol in Indian culture.

  To create this, I used splines to design a mandala drawing in Fusion360, then extruded each set of features to varying heights to create a "mandala tower."

  I then exported this Fusion360 object to .stl format, and sliced it in the Prusa slicer. Next, I loaded it into the 3D printer, and printed it.

  3D printing technology offers both benefits and drawbacks. Creating shapes such as this mandala would be difficult, if not impossible, using traditional subtractional methods of making. However, 3D printing is time-consuming. This relatively small object (5 centimeters in diameter) took an hour and a half to print. In addition, 3D printed objects can be brittle and are affected by shear stress due to the arrangement of filaments.

  In addition, this week, I used a photogrammetry application called SCANN3D to scan a yellow hobby motor.
  To make this scan, I  walked around the motor, taking photos of it at certain intervals, which the application stitched together into a 3D scan.
