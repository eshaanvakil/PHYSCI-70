  ### Week 1: Introduction 
  Today is the beginning of my PHYSCI-70 journey! This week, we began by creating our website documentation. This involved setting up Github on my PC, as well as downloading a website template, that I've begun to customize.

  - My Website Begins
  
  I plan to add onto this website as the course continues, including changing styles and adding additional functionality.

  I've also begun to brainstorm my final project, which unifies my interest in water conservation with this class's ethos in solving problems in innovative ways. One major problem in desert regions like the one I come from is overirrigation of ornamental plants and other crops, leading to water wastage. One solution could be a device that automatically shuts off water flow to plants if their water needs have been met. This could be accomplished with some sort of sensor that measures soil humidity, which then activates some kind of valve, shutting off the water. I can't wait to further flesh out this project in coming weeks!
