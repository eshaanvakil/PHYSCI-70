  ### Week 1: Introduction 

  This week, I was feeling homesick, so I wanted to use milling and molding to create a small desk ornament to remind me of my home state of Nevada. To do that, I first had to design the ornament mold in Fusion360. I began by finding a vector image of the state and importing it into Fusion360. I then used Fusion360's native character writing system to write the word "Nevada" on top of it. Finally, I flipped this design over the Y-axis in preparation for the inevitable molding, so that the design would appear right-side up once molded and flipped.

  I then extruded the state outline as well as the letters, and then created a border around the mold to contain it. This created a mold approximately 20 millimeters deep and 50 millimeters in width and length. I then exported this Fusion360 file to STL.

  The STL file is downloadable [here](../Nevada_mold.stl).

  After this, I loaded it into 'mods' and fitted a 1/8th inch bit into the SRM-20 mill. I then put a piece of wax into the mill and started the milling process.

  I then trimmed the mold, removing the excess wax block, and found my molding material. I decided to use Ecoflex 00-10, a softer-than-skin silicone material.

  I mixed the Ecoflex and then used it to fill the mold, letting it sit for five hours.

  The mold overflowed slightly, which turned out to be beneficial, as it allowed me to pull the silicone cast out of the mold easier. Below is the final product!
