  ### Week 11: Computer Programming 

  I wanted to use this week to familiarize myself with WebSockets. To that end, I decided to use [this RandomNerd tutorial](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-webserial-library/) to create a web server that displays serial data gathered from said hygrometers.
  This tutorial uses a library called WebSerial, as well as two packages for ESP32 webservers called ASyncTCP and ESPAsyncWebServer. These allow us to create ESP32 web servers beyond simple HTML GET pages.
