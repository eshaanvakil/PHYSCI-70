  ### Week 1: Radio, WiFi, Bluetooth (IoT) 

  Here is an image: 

  This week I decided to use the Internet of Things to solve a very pressing issue in my own life. My roommates frequently host large social gatherings in our common room, and these gatherings tend to be quite loud. Normally I appreciate the ability to socialize without leaving home, but every now and again I have to go to bed and can't sleep because all the people in our common room are too loud.

  Instead of picking the obvious option and having a conversation with my roommates about it, it would be much more funny to be passive-aggressive about it and use the Internet of Things to create a noise indicator, which would tell my roommates that they're being too loud.

  In technical terms, I want to control a LED strip with a LAN server. The LAN server would display a webpage in which I could indicate how loud my roommates are being ("not loud", "somewhat loud," and "very loud"), and the LED strip would change colors based on that.

  To make this, I began by creating a simple WiFi LAN server on the ESP32 Huzzah. This program also initializes a strip of four LEDs using the FastLED library. The server has three GET links, each of which corresponds to a volume level. Once clicked, each changes the colors of the previously-initialized LEDs (Very High is red, Medium is yellow, and Quiet is green).

  The code is below:

  ```
  /*
 WiFi Web Server LED Blink

 A simple web server that lets you blink an LED via the web.
 This sketch will print the IP address of your WiFi Shield (once connected)
 to the Serial monitor. From there, you can open that address in a web browser
 to turn on and off the LED on pin 5.

 If the IP address of your shield is yourAddress:
 http://yourAddress/H turns the LED on
 http://yourAddress/L turns it off

 This example is written for a network using WPA encryption. For
 WEP or WPA, change the Wifi.begin() call accordingly.

 Circuit:
 * WiFi shield attached
 * LED attached to pin 5
